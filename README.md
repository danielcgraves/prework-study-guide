# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this prework study guide webpage in order to prepare for the Coding Bootcamp that I am participating in this year. Creating this webpage helped me to understand some of the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.

## Usage

This prework study guide is mainly here to help us stay organized and keep notes for the bootcamp. You can also open the DevTools on this webpage to see how/if the JavaScript code is running properly. The current JavaScript code will list the topics that we learned about in our prework modules.
